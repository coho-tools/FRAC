2012-06-10: Fixed the random result bug. 
  Jijie reported that the result from Coho-Reach is kind of random. 
  The problem was caused by the compareTo function in the ReduceEvent class, which uses hasCode to compare. 
  Therefore, the compare result depends on hasCode which is random from different Java runs. 
  I made such stupid mistake was because I was not familiar with Java at that time and thought the remove function from PriorityQueue is based on the compareTo function, instead of the object reference. 
  With this bug fix, I have change the version to 1.0.1.
